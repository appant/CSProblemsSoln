Word break implementation comparative study: Between iterative and recursive approach.

1) How to build?
   g++ wordBreakIterative.cpp wordBreakRecursive.cpp wordBreakTest.cpp -o wordBreakTest
   
2) Run the application. 
   wordBreakTest
   The program uses the input file wordsforproblem.txt that contains a dictionary of words. 

The iterative approach proved approximately 4 times faster than recursive approach for the same input.
